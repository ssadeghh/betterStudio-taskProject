# Todo App

Welcome to the Todo App! This is a simple application that helps you manage your tasks using three lists: "Todo," "Doing," and "Done." You can easily add or delete tasks from these lists. When you check off a task, it will be moved to the top of the "Done" list after 3 seconds. If you uncheck a task, it will be moved to the top of the "Todo" list. Additionally, you can edit each task by clicking on it and making changes.

## Features

- Three task lists: Todo, Doing, and Done.
- Add, delete, and edit tasks.
- Automatic task reordering based on task status.
- Tasks are saved using localStorage, ensuring persistence across page refreshes and browser closures.
- Comes pre-loaded with 7 tasks for first-time users.
